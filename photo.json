    "description" : "<p><em>​</em>After an active night, the Pacers added two key pieces on Thursday in the first round of the 2021 NBA Draft, Oregon guard Chris Duarte and Kentucky big man Isaiah Jackson.</p><p>First, the Pacers selected Duarte with the 13th pick. A 6-6 guard, Duarte shot 42.4 percent from 3-point range as a senior at Oregon, where he was named Pac-12 Player of the Year and an All-American after averaging 17.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.9 steals.</p><p>Originally from the Dominican Republic, the 24-year-old came to the United States in high school and spent two years in junior college before enrolling in Oregon in 2019. </p><p>'A kid from the Dominican Republic...not a lot of kids make it out,' Duarte said. 'So me being one of those kids, it's a blessing. I'm grateful for my family and the people that helped me to get here. I'm grateful for the work I put in...I'm really excited about the future.'</p><p>Duarte told the media after being drafted that he felt good about the fit with the Pacers after visiting the team last week.</p><p>'I went to Indiana and I had a great, great workout there. I met with the front office and we really connected well...When I left Indiana, I was confident in myself. So I knew if I was on the board by Indiana coming to pick, I knew that there was a high chance that they were going to take me.'</p><p><strong>PHOTO GALLERY: <a href='https://www.nba.com/pacers/gallery/pacers-draft-chris-duarte-2021-nba-draft'>Pacers Select Chris Duarte »</a></strong></p><p>The feeling was definitely mutual. The Pacers also came away impressed from Duarte's workout and interview and were thrilled to see him on the board at 13.</p><p>'I think he's got a great chance to crack our rotation right off the bat,' Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said. 'One of the reasons that we were drawn to him was the fact that he was more of a finished product than a lot of the guys in the draft and we're trying to get healthy and win games.' </p><div style='display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;'><iframe id='twitter-widget-0' src='https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3NwYWNlX2NhcmQiOnsiYnVja2V0Ijoib2ZmIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd192ZGxfY2hpcnBfMTI3OTQiOnsiYnVja2V0IjoiY29udHJvbCIsInZlcnNpb24iOjN9fQ%3D%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1420950199455911936&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fpacers%2Fnews%2Fpacers-draft-chris-duarte-isaiah-jackson-2021-nba-draft&amp;sessionId=0b16991b55c998db655711e14bfd7eae1f00d53c&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=1890d59c%3A1627936082797&amp;width=550px' style='position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 801px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;'></iframe></div><p>Carlisle said Jackson will immediately be one of the best athletes on the Pacers roster and was impressed with his coachability.</p><p>'I'm a hard worker,' Jackson said. 'I bring it all, I'm a defensive anchor. I'm going to be their energy guy that Indiana needs and like I keep saying, I can't wait to get there and get to work and show everybody, prove everybody wrong.'</p><p>In their two picks, the Pacers got two very different types of players. The 24-year-old Duarte could play right away, while Jackson may take longer to develop, but could ultimately have the higher ceiling.</p><p>'We kind of had the philosophy tonight that we had two opportunities to take a swing at the plate,' Buchanan said. 'And we wanted to kind of go for what we felt was a pretty sure thing and we wanted to take a swing with the other one (at) a younger, more high-upside potential.'</p>",
